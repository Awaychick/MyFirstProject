                    <h3>Robert Smith, Sydney</h3>
                    <p>“I have tried all the market trading systems out there, and most of them DON’T WORK. In the long run, the only people that profit are the people that make the software. After using the Boab Tree for just three nights I have already DOUBLED my money and am set for an early retirement, thank you!!”</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Secret Weapon</h3>
                <p>You may be thinking we sound pretty confident. We’ve shown you the results, we’ve offered you a free invite to get a feel of the Boab Tree for yourself. It’s certainly a different approach to the other trading rooms and courses out there. You may be wondering “Why are these guys so confident?”.</p>
                <p>Good question! The fact is the <span>Boab Tree’s</span> trading method incorporates more than just the technicalities of successful trading. And it’s not just the 70:1 leveraging on your investment, though that helps! </p>
                <p>The fact is, as any experienced trader will agree, there’s an ocean of human emotion, especially fear and greed, between simply ‘knowing’ and actually ‘making’ the right trade. Trading beneath the cool leaves of the <span>Boab Tree</span>, you’ll find there’s another component you need to master - and that’s you.</p>
                <p>Fear and greed are not to be underestimated. Even priceless advice is useless if you can’t follow it. The big question is, have you got the discipline to follow the winning principles? If not, please don’t waste your time or ours. If you do, then welcome to the <span>Boab Tree…</span></p>
